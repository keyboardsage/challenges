List of challenges I would like to improve.

Easy
---
* **sum of primes** needs to be faster
* **query board** needs to be faster
* **minimum distance** is very slow and needs improvement
* **the major element** is very slow and needs improvement
* **word to digit** code needs to be found and uploaded
* **simple or trump** occasionally gets partials depending on input
* **chardonnay or cabernet** is 97.5% partial solution

Moderate
---
* **prime numbers** needs improved prime algorithm
* **counting primes** could use improved prime algorithm
* **email validation** is 90% partial solution
* **cash register** is 75% partial solution, needs major improvement
* **string rotation** is 50% partial solution, needs complete overhaul
