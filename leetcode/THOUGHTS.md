| Number     |     Name      | Difficulty  | Language | Filename | Notes/Hint  |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1    | Two Sums                      | Easy | C | 1_two_sums.c                   | Don't compare indices already compared.  |
| 9    | Palindrome Number             | Easy | C | 9_palindrome_number.c          | Convert half the palindrome to base 10 and compare it to the remaining half. |
| 14   | Longest Common Prefix         | Easy | C | 14_longest_common_prefix.c     | Compare each character of an arbitrarily chosen word one-by-one against all words adn keep the characters that all the words have in common. |
| 20   | Valid Parentheses             | Easy | C | 20_Valid_Parenthesis.c         | Use a stack. Increment on open and decrement on close. |
| 344  | Reverse String                | Easy | C | 344_reverse_string.c           | Iterate for half the word length, swapping characters. |
| 504  | Base 7                        | Easy | C | 504_base_7.c                   | Base conversion is just a division, modulus, and accumulator. Division and Modulo use the new radix. The accumulator uses the old radix. |
| 1009 | Complement of Base 10 Integer | Easy | C | 1009_complement_of_base_10_integer.c | The binary complement of the signed input produces a negative signed output. You must inverse the integer and also disregard the sign bits. Return the "unsigned"/value portion only. |
| 1380 | Lucky Numbers in a Matrix | Easy | C | 1380_lucky_numbers_in_a_matrix.c | No special tricks. |
| 1572 | Matrix Diagonal Sum | Easy | C | 1572_matrix_diagonal_sum.c | No special tricks. Simple, just busy work. |
| 1837 | Sum of Digits in Base K       | Easy | C | 1837_sum_of_digits_in_base_k.c | Same principles as #504 but the accumulator is only a summation of the one's place. |
